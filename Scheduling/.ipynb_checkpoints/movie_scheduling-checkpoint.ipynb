    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Imagine you are a highly-indemand actor, who has been presented with offers to star in n different movie projects under development. Each offer comes specified with the first and last  day of filming. To take the job, you must commit to being available throughout  this entire period. Thus you cannot simultaneously accept two jobs whose  intervals overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Criteria\n",
    "You want to make as much money as possible. Because each of these  films pays the same fee per film, this implies you seek the largest possible  set of jobs (intervals) such that no two of them conflict with each other."
